## The store(y) of my life: having little time but many clothes

Growing up with a shop-aholic mother and sister (common Italian disease ðŸ˜‚: [compulsive buying disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_buying_disorder)) as soon as I got a job, it also felt natural to start buying myself clothes and accessories. These quickly became habits when I started producing visual media, especially for [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fabiuzs/?hl=en), because I thought I always needed to present myself with a different and new outfit. I ended up buying stuff every week, often pieces I didnâ€™t even like just because they were [on sale](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/07/patricia-field-interview). As time went by all these clothes were making a pile because I felt guilty trashing clothes unless they were done for (I mean with holes, stains or a major loss in color). 

## Canâ€™t close the wardrobe because it is full of clothes

Even if I was donating all my synthetic clothes (by recommendation of my doctor) and I shrank some in the dryer, it wasnâ€™t enough. I couldnâ€™t stop myself from keeping too many pieces thinking theyâ€™d become fashionable again or would have been good for something some day (maybe for a theme party) or just for affection to the single piece. 
I realised I really had a problem when I was wearing only the same clothes (mostly the older ones) because the new ones were staying hidden at the bottom of the garderobe and I forgot that I even had them. I couldnâ€™t really see what was in there anymore and it was taking a lot of my time to choose what to wear.

### I'm starting from the man in the gardrobe: how to save money and even more

When Covid came, I (finallyðŸ˜…) had less reasons for shopping and stopped buying. I also had much more time to think and realised that maybe this might have been part of a bigger problem that extended outside my closet. So I decided to take action and thought making space in my closet would also open my mind. Even if it is a process still in progress, knowing better what is in my closet helps me to feel better with what I am wearing and in my life. Collecting stuff that I donâ€™t really need was a waste of my time and unfortunately on the large scale at which this happens, it is also a [waste of energy for the planet](https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/shopping-addiction-fashion-environment). For example, have you ever needed to re-wash a dress that you let sleep in the closet for too long before you wear it again, because it smells? In short: wouldn't it be great to slow down collecting and really learn how to make the most of what we already own?

### Finally seeing the end of the drawer

What is helping me to achieve this goal is also that I started to live as a digital nomad. I haven't lived longer than a month in a place in the last year and I realised that the clothes you really need daily can fit into a ðŸ˜˜ suitcase (unless you are going to [ski, but thatâ€™s another story](https://www.thefabryk.com/blog/european-snow-pride-in-tignes/)â›·). I started, therefore to stop buying new things and use only what I have (which also helps me to see whatâ€™s my color). Of course it also doesn't mean I have to walk around looking like trash: as soon as my favorite mesh tank top breaks, I buy a new one âœ¨.

### If you also feel like you are sinking into â€˜thingsâ€™, here are some things you can do:

* Avoid the sales period and shopping streets (especially on the weekends, anyway they are hideous)
* Stop giving as a present gift cards (also hideous; if you don't have time to think about a gift, is it so wrong not to doing it at all?)
* Use [app](https://www.sustainably-chic.com/blog/used-clothing-apps) like Vinted, depop or facebook marketplace to sell your clothes
* Make a [secret (no) Santa (no) party](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Secret-Santa) where guests bring clothes they don't use as presents
