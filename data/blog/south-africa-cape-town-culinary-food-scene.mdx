### What to Eat and Drink in South Africa?

Some of the must-try South African specialties include the Braai, Babooti, Banana Leaf Cake, Boerewors sausage, and the famous wines.

A [**Braai**](https://www.trafalgar.com/real-word/ultimate-guide-south-african-braai/) is a traditional South African barbeque, and it is a social event that brings people together. It is an essential part of South African culture, and it involves grilling meat, sausages, and vegetables over an open fire. If you want to experience a Braai, you can head to a local park or beach and join the locals. There are also many restaurants that offer a Braai experience, such as [The Butcher Man](https://www.thebutcherman.co.za/) in Green Point.

[**Bobotie**](https://tasteoftheplace.com/bobotie/) is a spicy lamb and beef stew that is made with fragrant spices and vegetables and covered in an egg custard. It is a popular dish in South African households, and you can find it in many restaurants but even pre-made in the supermarket. While Ryan was not so much of a fan, calling it a dessert with minced meat (comparing it to [the meat-filled trifle Rachel made in that long-ago Friends episode](https://www.today.com/food/friends-meat-trifle-episode-how-it-came-be-t162071)), but I admittedly liked it a lot, picking it up a few times from the local Kwikspar.  

[**Boerewors sausage**](https://www.curiouscuisiniere.com/boerewors/) is a traditional South African sausage that is made with beef, pork, and spices. It is often served with [pap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugali#:~:text=Pap%20%2F%CB%88p%CA%8Cp,meal%20(coarsely%20ground%20maize).) (maize meal) and [chakalaka](https://www.africanbites.com/chakalaka/) (a spicy vegetable relish). I usually love sausages but this one was way too salty for me and looked a bit too much like a massive ðŸ’©.

South Africa is also known for its wines, especially the famous Cape wines. Some of the most popular wines include Pinotage, Chenin Blanc, and Sauvignon Blanc and you can find some good wineries just at the gates of the city like the boutique wine farm [Beau Costantia](https://www.beauconstantia.com/). For an even larger selection of wines and wineries, you can head just under an hour outside the city to the gorgeous towns of Stellenbosch and Franschoek (you must try [the wine tram](https://www.getyourguide.com/cape-town-l103/from-cape-town-franschhoek-wine-tram-hop-on-hop-off-t173274/?partner_id=8DDMSUV&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=franschoek_wine_tram)).

### From Italian Cuisine to Japanese Buffets: Cape Town's Foodie Hotspots

If you're visiting Cape Town and looking for great places to eat, there are literally tons of options! One of the trendiest, hippest spots now is [The Old Biscuit Mill](https://theoldbiscuitmill.co.za/) in Woodstock which offers a Saturday and Sunday market filled with food stalls rocking cuisines from all over the world. You can find food from other African countries here, making it a must-visit destination. We tried the Zimbabwean food and it was damn good (along with some oysters and bubbly)!

If you're looking for another food market (these seem to be omnipresent during Cape Town's summers), you'll definitely want to check out the [Oranjezicht Food Market](https://ozcf.co.za/market-day/) at the V&A Waterfront. This is the fancier version of a food market and offers a wide variety of gourmet foods from everywhere.

For a more upscale dining experience, consider visiting [La Perla](https://laperla.co.za/). This Mediterranean-style restaurant is situated on the ocean with a terrace that provides a beautiful view of the sunset. They offer a decent selection of Italian food with a ton of South African wines.

If you're in the mood for Japanese food, there are two great restaurants to choose from. Our first experience at [Best Of Asia Green Point](https://www.facebook.com/people/Best-of-Asia-Green-Point/100064042293420/?paipv=0&eav=AfbKZrjPP6m7djFMB-AQfqCkGuOulqk9XRZ99xgBHXPuIaGnMCOGvfWzUtD8-Xx8Zrs&_rdr) during [load-shedding](https://thefabryk.com/top-10-tips-for-digital-nomads-cape-town) was surreal and a bit frustrating. We didn't realize why the conveyor belt that typically brings guests endless amounts of sushi was not functioning due to the power outage, but despite that, the food was still top-notch and fresh. The best part? It's incredibly affordable! For just 12 euros, you can enjoy their buffet, and even get to choose a Chinese dish to add to your meal. Just don't go during load-shedding ðŸ¤£. We made this a typical after-gym Monday tradition. Meanwhile, [Tjing Tjing House Rooftop Bar](https://www.tjingtjing.co.za/rooftop-2/) has a fancy balcony in the CBD district, but a much classier take on Japanese than Best of Asia.

If you're looking for a great place to grab a quick bite, [The Butcher Man](https://www.thebutcherman.co.za/) in Green Point is a good option -- with freshly braaied (bbq-ed) meats. For a more laid-back atmosphere, [Rockpool](https://www.rockpoolct.co.za/) in Sea Point is a popular spot with holiday vibes and frozen margarita beer cocktails called "coronaritas."

For breakfast or lunch, check out the [Bootlegger Coffee](https://www.bootlegger.coffee/) chain of restaurants or [Tiger Milk](https://tigersmilk.co.za/) -- which grills a banging burger and fries (their slogan is sickeningly *Dude Food Made Real Good*, though). And if you're in the mood for karaoke after you eat, [Bokeh](https://www.bokehfestival.co.za/) is one of the best places in the world to sing your heart out.

And since I am Italian, I always have to seek out the best pizzas in a place and in that case the crown goes to [I LOVE THE DOUGH](https://www.ilovethedough.co.za/). While the interior is a bit excessive, it serves up a delicious Napoli-style (but not exactly) pizza always with a side of fresh chili oil and garlic oil.

Other notable mentions include [Cause And Effect](https://causeandeffect.co.za/) for fab seafood platters and cool cocktails, [Blondie](https://www.blondie.bar/) for a fancy cocktail bar with a Mediterranean selection of tapas, and [Empire Asian Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312659-d3684608-Reviews-Empire_Asian_Restaurant-Cape_Town_Central_Western_Cape.html) for authentic Chinese food.

If you need a place to work and chill during the day, the [Nourish'd](https://nourishd.co.za/) chain is popular (and super vegan and hipster), but we prefer the colonial-style open-air restaurant in the must-visit Green Point Park, [Park Cafe](https://parkcafect.co.za/).

Finally, don't leave Cape Town without trying KFC (no link needed -- they are everywhere) after a drunken night out ðŸ¤£. It's popular here, and the chicken is kind of boiled and less fried than other KFCs I have experienced, which makes it maybe healthier (no evidence to support this claim, though)?!? They also serve the chicken with a bowl of gravy (with a small amount of mashed potatoes plopped inside), and the fries are a hit with the spicy salt!

#### If you are hangry for more, we mention a few other places in our [A Digital Nomad's Guide to Cape Town, South Africa post](https://thefabryk.com/blog/top-10-tips-for-digital-nomads-cape-town) and even go into our accidental fine-dining experience in [Exploring South Africanâ€™s Fine Cuisine Scene: Cape Town's Restaurant on the Pierhead](https://thefabryk.com/blog/fine-dining-experience-cape-town-south-africa).
