Hey everyone and welcome to our blog, The Fabryk, composed of Fabio and Ryan. For more, check out our [About Us](/about). 

We created this blog because frankly, we were uninspired and dissatisfied with our day-to-day and felt we needed a project to motivate ourselves and others around us. As gay men, we are bombarded with messages from all different mediums to be a certain way, when in fact, we should be embracing our uniqueness. We spend so much of our lives trying to hide and change ourselves to be something we are not, and while some of us are fortunate enough to come out and be accepted by those around us, it takes a long time to rebuild our authentic selves. 

We want our readers to become the best, most authentic versions of themselves by: 
- [Discovering new things](https://www.thefabryk.com/blog/best-aperitivo-milan/)
- [Learning to live non-conventionally](https://www.thefabryk.com/blog/best-alternatives-toilet-paper/)
- [Living freely outside of the closet](https://www.thefabryk.com/blog/book-review-velvet-rage/)
- [Discovering new places around the world](https://www.thefabryk.com/blog/xinjiang/)
- Becoming more open
- Quitting the things that dissatisfy them 
- Gaining confidence
- [Learning to live sustainably](https://www.thefabryk.com/blog/stop-using-toilet-paper/)
- [Improving both mental and physical health](https://www.thefabryk.com/blog/perfectionism-battle/)
- Making money 
- Bringing about valuable change to their communities

We try our best to not sound pretentious, as we are all in this journey together. Our intention is to merely inspire our readers. 

Much Love,
F + R
