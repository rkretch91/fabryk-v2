I always knew Cape Town was the gayest city on the continent of Africa, but I hadn't actually formed any expectations. Living mainly in Berlin, any gay-life would be a downgrade from what I consider to be the freest city in the world. Prior to our arrival, my friend forwarded me a grotesquely-designed calendar for Pride month, which happened to overlap perfectly with our stay in Cape Town; our last weekend would even be the Pride parade and related parties. Anyway, we went in with a relatively open mind and would just see how it went.

Our first taste of gay nightlife was in the form of a club called Pink Candy, located in the Central Business District (CBD). It was unfamiliar in every sense, from the tacky decorations, to the super camp music, to the cleaners mopping the floor next to you if even a drop of your drink fell to the floor while you danced. The crowd was incredibly sexy but I noticed a much more reserved quality to the people that I don't see as much in Europe, from the higher amount of clothing to the nervous body language. You can tell that people wanted to talk and strike up a conversation based on the glares, but seemed apprehensive to do so. In fact, I think we only managed to talk to foreigners the whole night, who seemed to feel the same as me. Nevertheless, it is a fun place to dance to nostalgic hits until 4 am, long past the other places around would have closed.

Mid-way through the week, we met up with a new friend at a place called Manhattan Cafe (or just Manhattans) in De Waterkant, an area known for being a gay haven. The place served up some nice cocktails and was a good place to make up for the lack of conversation we had at Pink Candy. This seems to be the place to go when you want to have a mid-week drink or get your weekend started, as it closes relatively early. 

As the days went on, we began to realize just how small the community was, often seeing people that we had seen in Pink Candy or Manhattans around town, especially at the gym. The more people we talked to, I couldn't help but notice a bit of a reserved-ness in actually calling it a community. Many guys on Grindr kept discreet profiles as not to be spotted around town and when I mentioned Pride events, some guys were just completely unaware that anything was going on. 

At one point, we ended up at a street event called Buddies, where it seemed like the entirety of the Cape Town gays were squashed together in a few square meters, the only thing breaking the awkwardness and overwhelmingness of it all being alcohol.

There were some redeeming qualities to the gay-life in the city though. I think my favorite place had to be Zero21, which gave inclusiveness vibes all around. While the other places people exchanged looks, here gays of all backgrounds co-mingled together and watched some hectic drag performances. The club was tiny, but it gave off the community vibe I expect from a more progressively gay city.
