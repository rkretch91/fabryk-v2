## Explore this: Some of the best travel apps for digital nomads in 2023.

Whether you're a seasoned digital nomad or just getting started, these apps can help make your journey smoother, more organized, and more enjoyable. From trip planning to downtime, we've got you covered. These apps are a bit more general and not location-based. For sure, each place you go to, there will be a bit more specific apps to download, but these are there to get you started. Let's get to it! 

### Splitwise to manage your expenses

[Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/) is an awesome tool for friends who want to keep track of expenses while hanging out together. With Splitwise, you can easily split bills, add expenses, and settle debts with your pals. One cool feature of the app is that you can personalize it with photos to make it more fun and engaging.

Ryan and I even make funny sexual references when naming expenses, adding some humor to sometimes not very happy expensive [experiences](https://thefabryk.com/blog/fine-dining-experience-cape-town-south-africa). Additionally, Splitwise is especially helpful when you're traveling and using cards instead of cash, as it allows you to easily keep track of all your shared expenses. 

### Talk360 for official communication

[Talk360](https://www.talk360.com/) is a mobile app that lets you make cheap international calls worldwide. It's user-friendly, has transparent pricing, and uses VoIP technology for clear connections.  You can even send text messages to any mobile phone number in the world at affordable rates, even if the recipient does not have the app installed on their device.

Talk360 also offers a range of payment options, including credit cards, PayPal, and in-app purchases. This makes it easy for you to add credit to your account and start making calls and sending messages right away. This means that you can see the cost of each call or message before you make it, which helps you manage your costs and avoid unexpected charges. Say goodbye to expensive international calling charges and hello to affordable communication!

### Komoot to stay fit

If you're not a fan of running like me, but your partner loves it and you want to join him, I recommend using an app called [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/). This way, you can at least make the experience more comfortable for yourself and find motivation by running in the most beautiful places. Komoot is a popular app for outdoor enthusiasts that offers detailed maps and personalized route planning for hiking, cycling, and running. It provides users with turn-by-turn navigation and highlights notable landmarks, scenic vistas, and other points of interest along the way. The app also allows users to save and share their favorite routes and discover new ones created by the community. Komoot is available for both iOS and Android devices. Otherwise, if you have the chance to sign up to a gym in the area where you are staying our favorite is still [Jefit](https://thefabryk.com/blog/best-apps-fitness-healthy-eating).

### Google Maps for your free time

Needless to say that Maps is an essential tool for everyone, and we use it particularly when it comes to finding dining places. With its robust search features, Google Maps makes it easy to filter your results by restaurant type, opening hours, and other criteria, allowing you to quickly find the perfect place to eat or to leech wifi, especially if you work remotely like us.

One of the key benefits of using Google Maps is its ability to provide detailed information, including user reviews and ratings, as well as photos of the venue and its dishes. This can help you make more informed decisions about where to go and what to order and can also alert you to potential issues like slow service or poor quality food. But if you are an indecisive person like us, It will not prevent you from having to [toss a coin](https://g.co/kgs/1yT7GS) to choose where to dine ðŸ¤ª (we admittedly do this quite often).
  
### Airbnb for accommodation

Airbnb is our favorite app for finding accommodation because it allows us to chat with the host and ensure that the place has everything we need, like good WiFi or a washing machine ðŸ§º (for my joy, a post about this topic is coming soon). Additionally, booking for a longer period can lead to discounts, making it a cost-effective option. However, if I'm willing to sacrifice location for savings, I prefer using [TrustedHousesitters](https://thefabryk.com/blog/how-to-get-free-accommodation-while-traveling-trusted-housesitters).

### Uber to drive safe
Uber is good for travelers because it provides a convenient and reliable way to request rides in unfamiliar places, with upfront pricing and no need for cash. It also allows travelers to track their driver's progress, rate their experience, and easily split fares with friends. 

It is more useful in some places than others, particularly if you feel inspired to come do a digital nomad stint in a place like [Cape Town](https://thefabryk.com/blog/top-10-tips-for-digital-nomads-cape-town).

### GetYourGuide to discover things to do
[GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/) app is good for travelers because it offers a wide range of activities and tours in popular destinations, allows for easy booking and cancellation, provides instant confirmation, and offers personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

**[Here](https://www.getyourguide.com/cape-town-l103/full-day-cape-peninsula-tour-from-cape-town-t68762/?partner_id=8DDMSUV&utm_medium=online_publisher&placement=content-middle&cmp=Cape_Town) are some random experiences to get your inspired juices flowing**

### Instagram because we are all in our loneliness together (or whatever that quote was) even on the other side of the world ðŸ˜‚

Okay, Instagram has now officially taken its place in the Cabinet of Horrors, alongside Facebook ðŸ«¢. However, it's still a great way to keep up with your "real" friends and see what they're up to when while travelling if you don't have enough time to reach out to them. Plus, you can share your own content and let them know you're not dead or kidnapped. In addition, more than once, I've casually found out that someone I know was visiting the same place as me and we hung out. This happens especially when i am travelling in a popular gay destination ðŸ™ˆ (this phenomenon is called [loop migration](https://www.audubon.org/news/ask-kenn-do-migrating-birds-take-same-routes-spring-and-fall) ðŸ˜‚).
  
### Spotify to not miss a beat
While I'm not fully aware of the reasons behind the dispute involving the label, the platform, and the artist, who unfortunately appear to be underpaid for their streaming and other contributions, I must confess that I still rely heavily on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/) when I'm traveling. I especially enjoy listening to older playlists of songs when I'm feeling nostalgic, as they remind me of past moments in my life and I feel more connected with my memory.

Ryan prefers SoundCloud when it comes to the music scene as you can listen to long DJ sets. He is even giving [DJing a shot himself](https://soundcloud.com/ryanchristoph) ðŸŽ¶.
