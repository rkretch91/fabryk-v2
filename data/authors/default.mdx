Hello from Fabio and Ryan, the fabric that makes up The Fabryk. We are 🇮🇹 and an 🇮🇹-🇺🇸/🇬🇧 mix, respectively, residing in 🇩🇪, but often finding ourselves in random places around the 🌍.

After we met, we quickly shared the same sentiment that our day jobs are killing us quickly. We decided we needed a project to put us out of our misery and save us. It began with a cooking show in only our underwear, but we barely have a working stove, so we didn’t get very far with that.

The more that we got to know one another and the more random adventures we encountered together (from watching feral cats to accidentally destroying a lord’s heirloom desk to almost being caught in the middle of a homicide situation in West background), the more difficult we found it to fit our project into a mould or niche.

So for the moment, we have settled on creating The Fabryk, a platform that mixes a little bit of lifestyle, travel, entrepreneurship, culture, personal development, failures, stories, and fun.

Our mission is a little obscure at the moment, but with a little trial and error, we will get closer to it with the overall goal of quitting our jobs (or at least getting fired and receiving generous German state benefits).
